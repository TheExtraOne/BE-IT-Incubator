## Technical Stack

- **Backend Framework**: Node.js/Express.js
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Validation**: Express-validator
- **Authentication**: JWT, bcrypt
- **Email Service**: Nodemailer
- **Testing**: Jest, Supertest
- **Architecture**:
  - Object-Oriented Programming with TypeScript classes
  - Dependency Injection for better testability and maintainability
  - Composition Root pattern for centralized dependency management

## Development Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```
3. Set up environment variables (see Environment Variables section)
4. Run development server:
   ```bash
   yarn watch
   yarn dev
   ```

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with:

- `PORT`: API gateway port (default: 3000)
- `MONGO_URL`: MongoDB connection string
- `LOGIN_PASSWORD`: Authorization credentials
- `JWT_SECRET` and `JWT_EXPIRY`: Ordinary JWT settings
- `AC_SECRET` and `AC_EXPIRY`: Ordinary access token settings
- `RT_SECRET` and `RT_EXPIRY`: Ordinary refresh token settings
- `MAIL_RU_PASS`: Password for using nodemailer
- `RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW`: Time window for rate limiting in seconds (default: 10)
- `RATE_LIMIT_MAX_REQUESTS`: Maximum requests per time window (default: 5)
